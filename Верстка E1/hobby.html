                If you wondering am I writing this text by my own than the answer is yes. 
                Even withouth the translator. You may be asking: 
                why is it so? The font I`ve downloaded does not support the Russian alphabet but I want to force it to look nice
                anyway and so I have no other options than to proceed.
                When I`ve started to code as a beginner it seemed to me very hard and 
                that first impression continues to stay like that untill today.
                Anyway no pain no gain. I`ve learned a lot for now: stuff 
                like Python, Django and <span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" class="SUS">HTML+CSS</a> </span> . It was hard and took a lot of
                free time but I kept going and always will.
